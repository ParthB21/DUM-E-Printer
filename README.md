# DUM-E Printer
## The Inspiration
We wanted to build our own 3D printer. Being die-hard Tony Stark fans, we decided to make a SCARA-style 3D printer. Introducing DUM-E Printer! It is a 5-axis robotic arm with with an extruder attached to the end to 3D print. Jokes aside, this project is really useful, becuase unlike the conventional fusion printers, the SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robotic Arm) style printer is not limited by the volume of the printer bed. Morevoer, it's a lot more precise and offers greater flexibility because it has 5 axes of rotation and can directly print on top of any surface. Most importantly, SCARA-style printers are really expensive with almost no options for hobbyists. The only SCARA printers we could find were for industry and not amateurs, thus we took it as a challenge to make one and possess this cool Tony Stark-style tech.

## The Struggle
This was an extremely challenging process partly because there is no tutorial to make a SCARA 3D printer. We used a bunch of tutorials as references [in-text citation] to make a robotic arm and then figured out a way to add the 3D printer extruder to it. It's safe to say that in the past 3 weeks, 2 amateurs have become Onshape pros.

## Technical Features
We plan on using an affordable prebuilt extruder from Creality to do the actual printing. The Marlin firmware is run by an Mks Robin Nano Motherboard. For the printer's display, we have a TS35 Touchscreen. DUM-E Printer uses 5 Stepper Motors to achieve motion. There are multiple bearings in the joints to facilitate rotation.

Note: The different colors were just an internal decision to keep track of changes and versions for different edited parts near the end
