# July 1: Brainstorming
## Hours Spent: 0.5
We decided to build a SCARA 3D printer from various different options. We discussed what features we want our 3D printer to have and looked for inspiration from other 3D Printers.

Some features we want to include:
- 5 DOF Arm with a 3D printed case
- Some configuration of an extruder
- Info display screen (temperature, progress, etc.)

# July 3: Working on BOM
## Hours Spent: 3
We decided to start working on the BOM to get a better idea of the dimensions of the parts and electronics to start working on the wiring diagrams and the CAD. We referred to the following tutorials to get a better sense of how our printer will work:
- https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Guides/How-to-Build-a-3D-Printer/FFF.html
- https://roboticworx.io/blogs/projects/build-a-5-axis-industrial-grade-robotic-arm-that-learns-how-to

Then, we came up with a rough idea for the BOM:
- Servos or stepper motors????
- Belt, pulley wheels, bearings, wires, jumper wires
- Motherboard (preferably with Marlin 2.0)
- Extruder stuff
- Power supply
- Filament (for the 3D printed shell of the arm)

We also started gathering links for some of the major expenses and parts for a proper BOM:

We plan to finish the BOM while working on wiring diagrams and CAD simultaneously to make sure we include all of the components needed to make the project.
